=Bug reports=

Scoring is by type of bug:
*0.5: glitch or annoyance or documentation error, compile errors
*1: normal bugs (e.g. something doesn't work)
*1.5: harmless crash/freeze/state or data corruption or harmless BUG message
*2: data loss/corruption or harmful crash/freeze (any crash while editing or playing a game is harmful)
Everyone in the 'Reporter' column gets the points.

''Fixed?'' shows whether and when it was fixed:
*'''X/#''' (letter/number) shows it was fixed in version X (E: [[etheldreme]], F: [[fufluns]], etc), i.e. in nightlies ''before'' X. ''#'' is the [[SVN]] revision(s) fixing it
*'''X/yes''' means it was fixed for version X but I didn't note down the SVN revision
*'''X/part''' means partially fixed for X
*'''no''' means I was busy fixing some other bug
*'''unmerged''' means it's nearly fixed, but hasn't been merged into svn yet, so isn't in nightlies
*'''notabug''' means it's not our fault, but thought someone deserved a reward
*'''wontfix''' it's broken, but we can't fix it or it's not worth fixing (not counted in summary table)

''Version'' tracks the version the bug was ''reported'' in and whether the bug is new or not:
*'''X''': present in version X, unknown whether it was in version X-1
*'''X-''': reported in version X, was also present in X-1
*'''X!''': present and new in version X, wasn't in version X-1
*'''X+''': present and new in nightly builds since X, wasn't in X
*'''?''' suffix: only a guess
(This differs from system used on github: the table shows when the bug was reported not when it was introduced; plus also whether new in nightlies.)
Categorisation might not be 100% accurate.
